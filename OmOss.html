          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>
            Lucra is a voluntary organization that builds libraries all over the world. As of today, we have over 25 libraries, which is an incredible number considering that we started our work in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what makes our libraries so unique? Children come to us every day to read, and when they leave they get food or other items. How does this work? When a child comes to us, they are stampeded by an employee. The time the child spends at the library is registered and converted to how much the child can take with them on the way out. We do not lend books, we exchange knowledge for necessary resources to survive. In this way, the child helps both himself and the family by providing food for the table and the knowledge to obtain an education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Who works for us? Our staff consists of local adults and volunteers. The employees from the local community receive a fixed daily salary from us thanks to the fact that they want to help the children in the community. They are also allowed to read our books. The volunteers work with us for free and live for free in one of our homes built for the volunteers. The volunteers either help build new libraries, go out and fetch resources or are inside the libraries and help the children who are struggling or insecure.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of today, we have 150 employees in the libraries and over 600 volunteers!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our head office is located in Belgium, the address is Rue de Piétrain 90, 5377 Noiseux, Belgium. Here we are 10 employees working on the projects and measuring ours. We have no leader, but we each manage our part of the company and update each other or ask for advice. No one here alone decides what happens to the children.
          </p>

          <p>
            The construction of 10 new libraries is now underway. They are expected to be finished around Christmas. Of these 10 buildings, 5 are in Africa, 3 in Asia and 2 in South America.

            We try to make each day better than the previous one. Those who want to help, but who can not volunteer to send us books. These are sent to our main warehouse in Belgium. Here they are checked for damage, content and possibly translated.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to send us books, send them to Heirstraat 415, Manage 7170, Belgium</p>
